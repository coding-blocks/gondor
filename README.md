# Gondor

A platform for internal tools at Coding Blocks, hosted at https://tools.codingblocks.com. This project is part of boss, please check for [issues here](https://github.com/coding-blocks/gondor/labels/BOSS).

## Setup

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Setting Up Database

Follow the postgresql guidelines, [download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) an install postgres v9.6.

**Create Database**

```bash
psql -U postgres
> create database gondor;
> \q
```

**Update Env Vars**

```bash
touch .env

#.env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 #optional
DB_USERNAME=postgres #or any other postgres username
DB_NAME=gondor #optional
DB_PASSWORD= #postgres user password if any
```

**Run Migrations**

```bash
yarn sequelize db:migrate
```

### Setting Up OneAuth

This project uses OneAuth as a single sign on server. For authentication it is required for OneAuth to be either running locally or to have a client application created [here](https://account.codingblocks.com/users/me/clients).

(optional) Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/coding-blocks/oneauth) to setup up OneAuth locally.

**Config for OneAuth Client App**

```
domain = http://localhost:3000
default url = http://localhost:3000
callback url = http://localhost:3000/api/login/callback
```

If you have setup OneAuth locally, then [create a client application](https://github.com/coding-blocks/oneauth/wiki/Explicit-Authentication), get the `ONEAUTH_CLIENT_ID` & `ONEAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and add it to your `.env`.

Otherwise, similarly create a client application for authentication [here](https://account.codingblocks.com/users/me/clients), get the `ONEAUTH_CLIENT_ID` & `ONEAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` and add it to your `.env`.

**Add Env Vars**

```bash
#.env
ONEAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3838 #include only if oneauth setup locally
ONEAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_id>
ONEAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_scret>
```

### Running Development Server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
